	-- Cleaned out a bunch of poor logic in reorderform.py. dict.get() ruling the world. Language features are good for the line count, it seems.
	-- Generates basic narrative now. Does not apply styling (yet). Not because it would be hard to implement (it wouldn't), but because the style-guide is still up in the air and there are future features being hinted at which may land such a feature somewhere between superfluous and detrimental.
